## Git Workflow Exercise

[Article Link](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel)

Provided above is a link to an article about how developers can setup express and deploy it to vercel. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on how to create the express app via Node.js and create a basic server with a single GET endpoint. Afterwards, it covers how to configure this express project for vercel deployment.

I find this article interesting because I come back to it once in a while whenever I am developing and deploying an express app to the open internet. I have very much liked the conciseness and clarity of this article and I believe it is highly beneficial to the developer community.

Tahsin's Response: I agree and I really like the documentation of vercel and how easy it is to deploy from GitHub to Vercel compared to other hosting platforms. I think that other hosting platforms should try to follow this and make it easier to deploy from GitHub, especially because GitHub is the most common version control platform worldwide.
